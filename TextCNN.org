Github Implementation link: [[https://github.com/brightmart/text_classification/tree/master/a02_TextCNN][link]]
Very good explanation with image: [[https://github.com/brightmart/text_classification#2textcnn][link]]
for fine tuning the model, read this before proceeding: [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03820][link]]

for implementing the convolution layer of TextCNN in keras, use these links: [[https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/6547][link1]], [[https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/1023#issuecomment-157160311][link2]]
github implementation using the above mentioned code: [[https://github.com/LB-Yu/TextCNN-keras][link]]

another implementation: [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882][arxiv.org]], [[https://github.com/anmolsjoshi/textcnn.keras][github implementation of same]]
